            "Candlestick Anatomy & Sentiment: You will learn how to read candlestick charts not just as lines, but as a story of buyer and seller sentiment."
            "Body Size: A large body indicates strong conviction (sentiment) in that direction."
            "Wicks (Shadows): Long wicks represent a battle between buyers and sellers. For example, a long upper wick is bearish because it shows buyers pushed the price up, "
            "but sellers were strong enough to force it back down before the close."

            "MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): You will learn to use the MACD indicator to spot trend reversals. A crossover in the MACD lines can be a strong signal that a trend is changing direction, helping you avoid false breakouts."
            "Volume Analysis: Volume is used to confirm price moves."
            "Volume vs. Price: A price increase should be supported by high buying volume. If a stock spikes but the selling volume bars are equally high or higher, it indicates hidden weakness and a likely failure of the trend."
